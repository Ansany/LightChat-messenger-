# LightChat (messenger)

This is the messenger wich has 4 screens: welcome screen, registration, authorization and chat.

I used these things when I was creating this app:
 - Firebase 
 - The iOS Navigation Controller
 - Cocoapods and the Swift Package maneger
 - Table Views
 - creating custom UI with .xib files
