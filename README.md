# LightChat (messenger)

This is the simple messenger wich has 4 screens: welcome screen, registration, authorization and chat.

What I learned when I was creating this app:
 - working with Firebase 
 - The iOS Navigation Controller
 - Swift Loops
 - Cocoapods and the Swift Package maneger
 - Table Views
 - creating custom UI with .xib files
